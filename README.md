# English-Dictionary
This is a simple web application that allows users to search for words and view their definitions. The app utilizes an API to fetch word definitions and pronunciations.
To use the app, you'll need to obtain an API key from the API provider and add it to the app.js file. Without an API key, the app will not function fully.
To run the app locally, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Please note that you'll need to have an active internet connection to use the app, as it fetches data from the API in real-time.
